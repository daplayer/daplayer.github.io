## Connect your account

Connecting your SoundCloud or YouTube account is fairly easy. You can either
click on any links in the category of your choice in the sidebar; a panel will
be displayed allowing you to connect your account. You can also go on the
configuration page clicking on the associated icon (<span class="octicon
octicon-dashboard"> </span>) at the right hand top of the window.

Then, click on the button associated to the service you wish to connect your
account to.

> **Note**: You won't have to do this action every time you want to go on a
> SoundCloud or YouTube section; your account will stay active until you explicitly
> try to disconnect it (next section of this document).

### For SoundCloud

Once you clicked on the button, a new window will appear to let you enter
your SoundCloud credentials:

Once done, the window should automatically be closed and if you clicked on
a link inside the sidebar, the current page should be reloaded with your data
properly displayed.

### For YouTube

Once you clicked on the button, a new window will appear to let you enter
your SoundCloud credentials:

Then, you'll be asked to authorize DaPlayer to access to your YouTube data:


Click the "Authorize" button and then your data will be automatically fetched.

You just need to click on the "Authorize" button. Once done, the window should
automatically be closed and if you clicked on a link inside the sidebar, the
current page should be reloaded with your data properly displayed.

## Disconnect your account

If you want to switch to another SoundCloud or YouTube account or just disconnect
the current one, you can click on the dashboard (<span class="octicon octicon-dashboard
"></span>) icon at the right top hand of the window.

Then, scroll to the concerned section, and you'll see a button to disconnect your
account:

<div class="button">
  <span class="octicon octicon-x"></span>
  {{ site.data.youtube.en.youtube.disconnect }}
</div>

Just click on it and wait until the button shows that you can connect another
account.
